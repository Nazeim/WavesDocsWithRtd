# **Wallet Operations**

Waves allows you to hold and transfer WAVES, Bitcoin, Litecoin, Zcash, Ethereum, Euro, Dollar and other Waves Tokens on Waves blockchain. This works through a so-called Multi Gateway approach.

The user can send Bitcoins or another cryptocurrencies \( which are supported by Waves Client\) to another address within seconds. Moreover, it allows a cryptocurrency to be traded on the Waves decentralized exchange against any other token issued on the Waves blockchain.

## **Send Operation**

Waves Client gives the user a friendly interface where the user can get two different ways to send cryptocurrency in the same sending window:

1. By entering the Waves address of the recipient \(which is created within Waves blockchain system\).

2. By entering the other cryptocurrencies address which is created within another blockchain systems \(such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Zcash address \).

**Note:** See the example below of sending Bitcoin to two different addresses \(one as Waves address and the second as Bitcoin address in the same window\).
